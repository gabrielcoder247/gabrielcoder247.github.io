GitHub: [@azy64](https://github.com/azy64) worked on it. I created a new branch called "milestone-3 and he created form-style and form-style-2 branches", then i built the html structures for the third milestone, my contact form,  footer and socail icons and he styled my contact forms and the footer and the social icons, so we built myporfolio mobile version contact form aas collaborators. The goal was to combine all the tools and best practices I just learned into a repo: Github Workflows, Linters, Flexbox, Grid system, Documenting my repo professionally With a perfect README.`
